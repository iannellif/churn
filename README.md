# Churn prediction with ML and DL

## Overview
Hands-on session for the 'ML for finance' workshop at ETH Zurich.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer transaction features for modelling spending disengagement. 
The data is compressed in a `tar.gz` file for efficient storage and transfer.

## Models
We implement and compare several machine learning models for churn prediction:
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- LightGBM
- ANN

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison of different models
- Visualization of results, including confusion matrices and ROC curves

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- lightgbm
- torch
